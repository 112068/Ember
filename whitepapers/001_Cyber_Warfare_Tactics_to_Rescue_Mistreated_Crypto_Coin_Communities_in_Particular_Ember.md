Cyber Warfare Hacktivism to Rescue Mistreated Crypto Coin Communities in Particular Ember
=========================================================================================

The dominant use of the word "Cyberwarfare" has been greedily claimed by nation-states in their constant co-option under the auspices of their deep state mechanisms much to their benefit. I seek to propose a counter-example that is the inverse of the usual aggressor/defender false dichotomy spectrum proposed by their definitions. This role is a new role wherein the aggressive actions of a cyberwarfare agent are not only much needed, but also highly desired by most of the community.

The closest definition is through the usage of the term "hacktivist", though the motivations are not political, nor economical, but to change a social structure. The methods are undertaken as an aggressor against a system that was setup to abuse it's willing participants by a developer that wants nothing to do with the community any more. The reason this is interesting is because the entirety of the community derives the network and defines the crypto coin and thus they offer a person a way to legally and with consent utilize warfare methods against a "paper target" enemy, and thus harming no one and benefiting many.

Without the consent of the community the mechanism that justifies the actions I will highlight below as well as other possibilities will be removed by voluntarily ignoring any and all efforts a developer might make. With this in mind it would be a foolhardy task to undertake without having a firmy fixed moral compass and a broad philosophical understanding of Negative Liberties. Thus, I caution potential attemptees to not undergo this process for short term gain, or for the purposes of ego development. One must always keep in mind the whole throughout.

Make no mistake, though the terms are very nefarious sounding they nonetheless describe the amount of zealotry in applying the tactics in order to accomplish a rescue of a crypto coin's users from their system.

Is Direct Intervention Necessary?
---------------------------------

To answer this question in particular we must build a mind model of the state of a group in order to verify if direct intervention is necesssary. You might find the following questions useful.

* What are the stated goals of the community?
* What is actually delivered comparatively?
* What motivations did the creator(s) have that built a community?
* What do the creator(s) say vs. what the community says?
* What relationship do the two groups have now?
* What relationship did the two groups start with?

It is up to you whether direct intervention is necessary. In cases where it would be viewed as beneficial to the community as a whole there will exist a fundamental level of duplicity in the creator(s) which has revealed itself slowly or quickly, or a severe level of apathy and an apparent avoidance to anyone who comes openly from the community.

Fundamentals of Cyber Warfare "Hacktivism"
------------------------------------------

Listed below are an incomplete list of the tools at the disposal of a "hacktivist", though I'm sure there are more.

* Deception
* (Distributed) Denial of Service
* Subversion
* Virtual Sit In
* Culture Jams (or Subvertising)
* Reality Hacking
* Research
* White Hat/Grey Hat Cracking
* Development
